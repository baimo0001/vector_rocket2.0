# vector_rocket2.0
Nebula Technologyâ€™s second-generation vector attitude control rocket open source plan
In this generation of rockets, the structure is basically the same as the first generation, with only some minor adjustments during the assembly process. For the structural part, you can refer to: https://github.com/baimo0001/vector_rocket1.0 .
For the hardware part, we replaced the main control board with Seeeduino XIAO, used the MPU6050 attitude sensor, and redrawn the PCB to make the hardware circuit part more stable.
In the software part, Kalman filtering and PID control are added.
